# 🧠 AI Journey 2025

Welcome to my personal AI/ML/GenAI learning journey! This repo is my public log, where I’ll track daily progress, build projects, take notes, and document everything I learn on my path to becoming a world-class AI engineer by the end of 2025.

## 🚀 Goal

To master the fundamentals and advanced concepts of **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Generative AI** — with the long-term goal of building strong AI/ML expertise through consistent practice, hands-on projects, and open collaboration, as part of my mission to grow into the best version of myself in the AI/ML space.
